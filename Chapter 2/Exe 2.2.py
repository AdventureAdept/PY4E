Write a program that uses input to prompt a user for their name and then welcomes them. 
Note that input will pop up a dialog box. Enter Sarah in the pop-up box when you are prompted so your output will match the desired output.
# Name Printer
# Input: Sarah
# Expected Output: Hello Sarah

name = input("Enter your name")
print("Hello",name)
